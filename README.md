## List of MLB Data Challenges ##

Here are a number of challenges for the MLB dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018. These are intended for those new to pandas and sci-kit learn who want to learn data analysis using Python. The challenges are ordered from easiest to most difficult.

#### Challenge 1: Windiest Venue ####
Which venue is the windiest?
What is the average wind speed at this venue?

#### Challenge 2: Pitcher Speed ####
Which pitchers throw the fastest? 
Do faster-throwing pitchers get more strikeouts? 
Do they give up less runs?

#### Challenge 3: Pitch Classification ####
Find some way to classify pitches based on the attributes in the dataset. 
Which types of pitches are most difficult for batters to hit?

#### Challenge 4: Batter Analysis ####
Select a batter. Which types of pitches are they best at hitting? Which types are they the worst at hitting?
Write code that will perform this analysis on *any* given batter in the data set. 

#### Challenge 5: Pitch Prediction ####
Create an algorithm that, given a pitcher and sequence of pitches already thrown, will predict what type of pitch will be thrown next. 

#### Challenge 6: At-bat Outcome Prediction ####
Create an algorithm that will, given the variables in the dataset, predict the outcome of a given at-bat.
